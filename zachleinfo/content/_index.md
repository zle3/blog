Hello, my name is Zach and welcome to my blog!
I'm interested in modern systems administration including cloud technologies, traditional systems administration, and devops.

When I'm not studying or researching, you can find me administering (or even playing!) multiplayer games or services on my servers.

I have a test website located at [kotone.dev](https://www.kotone.dev) with more experimental features, tools, and articles.

Click here to find out what I'm doing right [now]({{< ref "now" >}}) or more about my [about]({{< ref "about" >}}).
