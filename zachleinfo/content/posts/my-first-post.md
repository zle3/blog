## Introduction

Welcome to my first website built from scratch! No more google sites so there's a lot to be planned. Since I'm now ditching Google, I'll need to self-host everything. I have an idea of what I'll need but I know more will pop up since this is my first time doing so. I'm thinking about using a static site host aka cloudflare as my cdn. This way, I'll have a stable way to host my portfolio. I'll use my development site [www.kotone.dev](https://www.kotone.dev) as my experimental site. There I will have a lot more interesting but definitely unstable options to view. I'll detail my upcoming plans in a future post so stay tuned for that.
