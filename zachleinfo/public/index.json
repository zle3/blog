No more google sites so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to be planned. Since I\u0026rsquo;m now ditching Google, I\u0026rsquo;ll need to self-host everything. I have an idea of what I\u0026rsquo;ll need but I know more will pop up since this is my first time doing so. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about using a static site host aka cloudflare as my cdn. This way, I\u0026rsquo;ll have a stable way to host my portfolio. I\u0026rsquo;ll use my development site www.kotone.dev as my experimental site. There I will have a lot more interesting but definitely unstable options to view.
